== What can you get with this app?

You'll get anagrams for a input word or phrase.

== How to deploy?

Clone the project, make sure that you have JVM installed, and run "./mvnw spring-boot:run" in a bash.

After that, you can test the app with the following address:
----
http://localhost:8080/anagram
----

this will respond with the anagrams

You can customize the word with an optional `word` parameter in the query string or introducing it into the input text:

----
http://localhost:8080/anagram?word=Test secret
----
